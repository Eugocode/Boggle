# Boggle
This is my project for CMSC 22.

Boggle is a word game which is played using a plastic grid of lettered dice, in which players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent letters.
This program is a Boggle Solver to find the valid words in the user defined 4x4 board.

  A word is valid if:
       1. Letters in the word are connected in adjacent way.
       2. The words are in the dictionary text file.
       3. The word length is 3 or more.
 
 A trie data structure is used to compose the words inside the dictionary into a Trie Tree.
 
 For the Design Patterns I applied the following:
 1. Creational Design Pattern - Prototype Design Pattern
 2. Structural Design Pattern - Composite Design Pattern
 3. Behavioral Design Pattern - Iterator Pattern & Command Pattern
